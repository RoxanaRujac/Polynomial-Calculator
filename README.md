# Polynomial-Calculator
PolynomialCalculator is a Java-based application designed to perform a wide range of polynomial operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivation, and integration. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and uses Spring for the user interface. It also includes unit testing with JUnit to ensure the correctness of operations.

Key Features:
- Perform essential polynomial operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivation, and integration.
- User-friendly interface built with Java Spring.
- Input validation and parsing using pattern recognition to ensure correct polynomial formatting.
- Follows the MVC architecture with separation of concerns:
    - **Model**: Handles the core logic and polynomial operations.
    - **View**: The user interface implemented with Spring.
    - **Controller**: Manages the interaction between the UI and the backend.
- Comprehensive unit testing with JUnit to validate polynomial operations and ensure robustness.

Technologies: Java, Spring Framework, JUnit
